Linear & Shift Invariance
  Possible properties of f
    -superimposition: f(I
    come back to this

Continuous Convolution
  -Definition:
    I`(X0,Y0) = integral(-inf, inf){integral(-inf, inf){f(X0 - X, Y0 - Y)I(X,Y)dxdy}}

    Notation: I` = f * I
    Propetries
      -linear

Discrete Convolution
  Sum instead of integral: I` = K * I is defined by:
    I`sub(i,j) = SUMMATION(sub(u,v) K sub(i - u, j - v) I sub (u, v)

    Convolution: correlation with kernel rotated 180 degrees
      -this distinction goes away for isotropic kernels

    Some ways to interpret what the kernel is doing
      -as simmply a set of weights on the corresponding image pixels

Computer Vision - Course Description
  A study of the techniques and applications of computer vision. Topics include: pattern recognition, filtering, texture, segmentation, recognition, 3D vision and case studies.

  We will study image augmentation; basic concepts in image processing such as smoothing, edge and feature detection, segmentation, and deep learning based applications

Low-level: Multiple Views
  Stereo
    -structure from two views
  Structure from motion
    -what can we learn in general from many views, whether they were taken simultaneously or sequentially?

Mid-level: Estimation, Segmentation
  Estimation: fitting parameters to data
    -static (e.g., shape)
    -dynamic (e.g., tracking)
  Segmentation/clustering
    -breaking an image or image sequence into a few meaningful pieces with internal similarity

High-level: recognition
  Recognition
    -finding and parametrizing a known object
    -assignment to known categories using statistics/probability to make best choice

Image Types
  Intensity: m x n matrix. can be:
    -uint8: unsigned 8-bit integer - i.e., in the range [0 ... 255]
    -double: real number in range [0 ... 1]
  True color: m x n x 3
    -three channels: red, green, blue
  Binary: values are - or 1, type = logical

Image Type Conversions
  Functions may (FILL THIS OUT FROM SLIDES)

Image Arithmetic
  Just like matrices, we can do pixelwise arithmetic on images
  Some useful operations:
    -differencing: measure of similarity
    -averaging: blend separate images or smooth a single one over time
    -thresholding: apply function to each pixel, test value

Thresholding
  Grayscale -> binary: choose threshold based on histogram of image intensities

Connected Components
  Uniquely label each n-connected region in binary image
  4- and 8-connectedness

Operations in Binary Images
  input
    -a binary image: B
    -structuring element: S, e.g., (3x3 matrix of 1's)

  dilated
  eroded

Geometric Image Comparison: SSD
  Given a template image I(sub T) and an image I, how to quantify the similarity between them?
  Vector difference: sum of squared differences (SSD)

  ∑[Iₜ(x,y) - I(x,y)]^2

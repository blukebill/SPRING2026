Computer Vision - Course Description
  A study of the techniques and applications of computer vision. Topics include: pattern recognition, filtering, texture, segmentation, recognition, 3D vision and case studies.

  We will study image augmentation; basic concepts in image processing such as smoothing, edge and feature detection, segmentation, and deep learning based applications

The Vision Problem
